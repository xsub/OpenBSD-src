# OpenBSD Zoned Block Device Experiments

Experimental OpenBSD source fork for native zoned block device support, focused on
host-managed SCSI ZBC / SMR disks and NVMe Zoned Namespaces.

This is research and bring-up work, not production-ready storage code.

## Goals

- Add a small native OpenBSD ABI for zoned block discovery.
- Support read-only zone capability queries and zone reports first.
- Add explicit zone management commands before ordinary host-managed writes.
- Keep host-managed devices safe until write ordering is implemented.
- Validate behavior with OpenBSD regress tests and QEMU-emulated zoned devices.
- Build toward real host-managed write support only after the read-only path is stable.

## Current Status

Implemented prototype pieces:

- `sys/sys/dkzone.h`
- `DIOCGZONEINFO`
- `DIOCGZONEREPORT`
- `DIOCZONECMD` for explicit open/close/finish/reset zone management
- `sd(4)` recognition of SCSI ZBC host-managed devices
- SCSI `REPORT ZONES` translation into OpenBSD `struct dk_zone`
- ordinary-write rejection for host-managed zoned disks
- regression smoke test under `regress/sys/sys/dkzone`
- initial NVMe ZNS reporting and zone management path
- QEMU/OpenBSD VM validation workflow

Tested so far:

- ABI regression builds and runs on OpenBSD/arm64.
- Non-zoned disk reports `zone_mode=0 (none)` and skips zone reports.
- Kernel boots on OpenBSD/arm64 VM.
- QEMU NVMe ZNS attaches as an `sd(4)` disk marked `zoned`.
- NVMe ZNS `DIOCGZONEINFO` and `DIOCGZONEREPORT` work in the VM.

## Test Helper

The regression helper lives at:

```sh
regress/sys/sys/dkzone
```

Run:

```sh
cd /usr/src/regress/sys/sys/dkzone
./dkzone-build.sh
./obj/dkzone /dev/rsd0c
./obj/dkzone -n 64 -s 0 /dev/rsd1c
./obj/dkzone -m reset -l 0 /dev/rsd1c
```

For the QEMU ZNS test disk, the smoke helper rebuilds `dkzone` if needed,
finishes the selected zone, verifies that it reports `full`, resets it, and
verifies that it reports `empty` again:

```sh
cd /usr/src/regress/sys/sys/dkzone
./dkzone-zns-smoke.sh /dev/rsd1c 0
```

`dkzone-zns-smoke.sh` mutates the target zone, so run it only against an
explicit scratch raw device and pass a zone-start LBA.

With a device argument, `dkzone` prints zone capability data and, for zoned
devices, a diagnostic table of reported zone descriptors.  The `-n` option sets
the maximum number of entries requested from the kernel, and `-s` sets the
starting LBA for the report.

On a normal non-zoned disk, expected output begins with:

```text
zone_mode=0 (none) flags=0x0 zone_size_lba=0
```

On a zoned device, the helper reports each returned zone with start LBA, length,
capacity, write pointer, translated type, translated condition, translated
flags, and raw protocol values.

The `-m` option issues an explicit zone management command.  Supported commands
are `open`, `close`, `finish`, and `reset`.  Use `-l` for a single zone LBA or
`-a` for the protocol's all-zones form.

## QEMU NVMe ZNS Target

QEMU 11 can expose an emulated NVMe Zoned Namespace. The current development VM
workflow uses an OpenBSD/arm64 guest on Apple Silicon with an optional second
NVMe ZNS test disk.

Example QEMU device shape:

```sh
-drive if=none,format=raw,file=openbsd-zns.raw,id=zns0
-device nvme,id=nvme-zns,serial=ZNS0001
-device nvme-ns,drive=zns0,nsid=1,zoned=on,zoned.zone_size=64M,zoned.zone_capacity=64M
```

Inside OpenBSD, inspect attachment with:

```sh
dmesg | grep -E 'nvme|sd[0-9]'
sysctl hw.disknames
```

## Roadmap

1. Stabilize reporting and management ABI.
2. Validate SCSI ZBC host-managed reporting against real or emulated devices.
3. Validate NVMe ZNS reporting under QEMU.
4. Add richer regress coverage for zone report layouts and option mapping.
5. Design safe write-path semantics for host-managed sequential zones.
6. Validate zone reset/open/close/finish operations on SCSI ZBC and NVMe ZNS.
7. Evaluate filesystem and buffer-cache implications before enabling writable host-managed devices.

## Non-Goals For The Current Prototype

- No production write support yet.
- No filesystem-level zoned allocation policy yet.
- No promise of ABI stability before review.
- No attempt to support drive-managed SMR specially; those already appear as normal disks.

## Safety Model

Host-managed zoned devices are exposed conservatively. The first milestone is
discovery, reporting, and explicit zone management. Ordinary writable support
must preserve sequential-write rules before it can be enabled safely.
